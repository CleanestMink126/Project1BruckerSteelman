### Hipster Paper Review
#### Matt Brucker

**Question:**
It feels pretty easy to understand what the question is, but it seems a little difficult to find the question, since it's somewhat buried at the bottom of the introduction - "Juul and Porter were interested in ... how many anti-establishment nodes (hipsters) needed to be present in a network for the anti-establishment idea to gain popularity." The motivations behind are similarly explained, but also hidden at the bottom of the introduction. Having a clear statement in the abstract of what question the experiment hopes to answer, and why it matters, would help clear things up!

**Methodology:**
I get a pretty good understanding of how things work, but there's still a few things that are unclear to me. How does the initial activity actually happen? Are a few nodes made active at the beginning of the simulation? I also couldn't seem to find an explanation of how phi is assigned to nodes. Is it random? Does every node have the same phi? Additionally, how does the first node decide which product to choose? Is there some "seed" product? Another thing that might be helpful is to talk a little bit about some features of the graph (e.g. size, degree, shape of the distribution, etc.) to give a bit of context for what we're looking at.

**Results:**
The graphs are easy to read - having legends on the graphs would be very useful, as it would make the graphs much easier to understand without looking at the caption. It could also be helpful to have a line at adoption fraction = 0.5 on your graphs, since it would help so that we could see how far from 50% adoption the products are. The graphs for tau = 4, 5, and 6 do look very similar - it might be insightful to just show the graphs at larger differences in tau, such as 1, 3, and 6.

**Interpretation:**
Having a graph that explicitly shows the behavior of the model at different values of tau could be useful, since that is the main conclusion you draw. I think you do a good job of explaining it across the graphs, but putting it into one cohesive graph would be helpful. Additionally, your conclusion is mostly about the effects of different values of tau, but the original question that you mention is regarding the percentage of hipsters necessary for the "unpopular" product to become more popular - you might want to connect it back to that.

**Replication:**
Overall, good comparison between the original and your replication. I like that you mention how your graphs compare to the original graphs presented in the paper - it might be useful to show those, but your validation seems sufficient. You do mention what dataset you use, and that your dataset is different from what the paper uses. It would be helpful to answer what data the paper uses, and how it differs from your network. What implications does that have?

**Extension:**
The extension seems like it's coming along pretty well. The questions I still have are: How does a BA model differ from the dataset that you used? What insight does that generate? What question are you answering by changing the starting parameters of the network?

**Progress:**
The replication looks pretty complete! There's a number of experiments and graphs that align with the paper. There also seems to be an idea of what will be done for the extension, but not a clear sense of what work the extension will be doing or what question it will be answering.

**Presentation:**
It seems like there's a good professional voice in the writing. The writing style looks like it follows the guidelines - A bit of mixing of tense with "we do x" and "we are doing x," but apart from that things look pretty great!

**Mechanics:**
Everything is in the right place and properly formatted.
