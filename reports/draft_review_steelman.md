#### Question: 
What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

The original purpose of the paper was to examine the change in trends when adding in the idea of a "hipster" who goes against whatever the current status quo is. This can be modeled by graphs based on Facebook and an algorithm that examines the state of each of its neighbors and changed base on whether it is a conformist or hipster. The explanation I felt was sufficiently clear to understnd what is happening.

#### Methodology:
Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The way they built the graph, and how they most likely implemented the node changing makes complete sense to me and seems to be completely covering the question. I am little confused about the use of the "activation" of each node. 
A) What is it? Deciding if a node will adopt a poduct or what?
B) What's the effect on the graph?
C) What is the relation of this property to real life?

#### Results:
Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

The graphical results make sense when explained, but it would be more helpful if the graphs had legends and titles, even if they just repeate what is in the description. Also, they refer to graphs presented from the base paper often. It would be much more helpful to see a side by side comparison of these graphs inside the document itself. 

#### Interpretation:
Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?



#### Replication:
Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the 

#### Extension:
Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

#### Progress:
Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

#### Presentation:
Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

#### Mechanics:
Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
